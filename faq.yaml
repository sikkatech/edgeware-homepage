    - question: What's the inspiration of the fork?
      answer: |
        Edgeware is an exciting new project, and will be one of the first chains launched on Parity’s 
        Substrate platform. While we applaud the testing of a novel form of distribution, (the lockdrop),
        the design of signalling in the EEdgeware lockdrop leads to many edge conditions that may hamper the optimal
        distribution of tokens and may increase the centralization of shareholdership. We offer our pre-genesis design for a
        balanced token model that is more inclusive of lockdrop and signal participants:

        1. Remove Signalling on Behalf of Contracts

        2. Remove Generalized Locking

        3.  All token allocations to signallers distributed fully at genesis.

    - question: Why is getting the initial distribution right important?
      answer: |
        The initial token distribution is of vital importance to any blockchain project with a viable
        economic model. This is especially true when on-chain systems of governance allow protocol
        level and other changes to be made through the votes and signals of token holders. Should
        an initial token distribution favor certain parties, dominant voting groups and blocks will
        continue to increase their power and distribution over time, shaping the future of any such ecosystem.

    - question: What's the issue with signaling on behalf of contracts?
      answer: |
        Allowing contract deployers to signal on behalf of contracts is a fundamental misunderstanding of
        the premise of smart contracting systems. Smart contracts are meant to be autonomous software that
        are independent of their initial deployer. For example, in the Golem and the Digix project multi-sigs,
        two of the largest in the Ethereum ecosystem, the deployer of the contract isn't even a member of the
        multisig, yet is able to signal on behalf of all of the funds therein. The same is true for many of the largest
        contracts on Ethereum, like the Wrapped Ether (WETH) contract, and we wanted to make this right in Straightedge.


    - question: What's the issue with generalized locking?
      answer: |
        A last minute change called Generalized Locking was added to the Edgeware lockdrop.  It was declared that
        "Generalized Lock" occurs when “an address that calls ‘Signal’ is unable to sign a transaction with
        msg.value greater than 0 for the entirety of the 3, 6 or 12-month lock durations”,
        and in these cases “that signal can be treated as a lock for the purposes of the allocation award”. 

        By removing the ability to signal on behalf of a contract, Straightedge has ntended to reduce vulnerabilities by
        simplifying the distribution mechanism.  However, it is still worth explicitly pointing out some
        of the issues with the policy. First, it places undue burden upon the launchers of the network to
        audit and decide on different generalized lock contracts, which may contain edge cases such as
        bypassing locking by issuing derivatives of the locked Ether (such as with WETH). Further, if a
        contract does not correctly lock, or if code claiming to be a lock bypasses detection through
        underhanded Solidity techniques, it could break the legitimacy of the initial distribution of
        the entire network. While Edgeware’s contract codes have been fully audited by Quantstamp,  Removing generalized
        locking removes the necessity for case-by-case decision-making by a launch-team, and other potential edge case
        vulnerabilities.


    - question: Were these faulty design decisions made in Edgeware to allow distribution to the victims of locked funds in the November 2017 Parity Multisig Exploit?
      answer: |
        The Web3 Foundation, the largest victim of the Parity bug, has a very close relationship
        with the Edgeware project, and it is likely it is due to the influence of the Web3 Foundation
        that these odd design decisions were made in the construction of the Edgeware lockdrop. But in
        trying to right a wrong by recovering funds, design decisions were made that could hamper the effectiveness of the
        project as a whole.
        
        Let’s be clear: Like many in the community, we feel for groups like the Web3 Foundation,
        and others affected by these attacks, but an open system of governance is one in which the
        people have a say, while a system in which rules are changed to provide select parties with
        powerful voting shares is not open. In the case of Edgeware, the potential for an open-future
        was impeded prior to launch by late-stage changes to a token distribution model that aimed to
        provide favor to several small, select group of individuals and teams. While the changes were disclosed before the
        lockdrop began The result would provide an estimated 9% substantial voting-percentage of all network-tokens to a
        party or parties not in full control of the funds for which tokens are rewarded.
        
        Nonetheless, the Web3 Foundation's support in funding the development of Parity Substrate
        (the framework upon which Straightedge is built) is undeniable. To that end, possible ways
        of rewarding them would be to use Straightedge’s decentralized on-chain governance process
        to award those with funds locked in the Parity multisig with the Straightedge tokens that
        they would have earned, had a successful signal been possible. This would allow the Web3
        Foundation to successfully execute on its goal of recovering value from their locked funds
        in a way that protects the legitimacy of the project, and which puts the issue to governance
        and ecosystem participants. Should such a proposal be rejected by governance, the receiver
        of the 10% founder's reward can also optionally choose to share their cut with the Web3 Foundation
        or Parity if they so see fit.


    - question: What is a zero-day fork?
      answer: |
        A zero-day fork is a novel type of fork in which two alternative implementations of a project
        are launched at the exact same time, on a brand new network. Both Straightedge and Edgeware
        are slated for launch on September 15, 2019. Thus far, in major network forks, we've seen both
        the incumbent network gain market superiority (in the case of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) and
        the challenger network gain superiority (in the case of Ethereum Classic and Ethereum). It will
        be an interesting experiment in governance to see the results of what happens in a zero-day
        fork that launches two networks at the same time.

    - question: How do I redeem my STR?
      answer: |
        It’s easy: All participants in the Edgeware lockdrop will receive STR to the same address and
        using the same seed, all on the new chain. Signalers that participated from non-contract addresses
        will receive STR in the genesis of the Straightedge chain as well, without a one-year wait. To
        use your STR, simply install the Straightedge code which is located here:

        https://github.com/sikkatech/straightedge-node/

    - question: How are STR tokens distributed?
      answer: |
        The proportions of the Straightedge genesis block distribution mirror the proportions of Edgeware Lockdrop and
        signal participants will receive 90% of STR tokens, with the exception of contributions
        through signalling on behalf of a contract. The remaining 10% of the distribution will be allocated as
        a founders’ reward to entities contributing to the launch of the Straightedge project.

    - question: What if I want to learn more about the lockdrop or technical details?
      answer: |
        Since Straightedge is a new project and a fork, we rely upon the efforts of the Edgeware developers for our
        documentatione At their site, https://edgewa.re, you can review the Edgeware FAQs where you can learn more about the
        lockdrop contracts, the software that Straightedge is based upon, and their incentives for validation.
